        In my previous tutorial, I explained how powerful Bootstrap 3 is for a novice designers. It ships with some of the best ready-to-use JavaScript and jQuery components and plugins. Recently the framework got a major update with version 3.1.0, bringing several important and necessary changes to the framework.

In this tutorial we will be talking about one of the most useful jQuery Bootstrap plugins, The Modal.

The Bootstrap Modal is a lightweight multi-purpose JavaScript popup that is customizable and responsive. It can be used to display alert popups, videos, and images in a website. Websites built with Bootstrap can use the modal to showcase (for example) terms and conditions (as part of a signup process), videos (similar to a standard light box), or even social media widgets.

Now let’s examine the different parts of Bootstrap’s modal, so we can understand it better.

The Bootstrap Modal is divided into three primary sections: the header, body, and footer. Each has its own significance and hence should be used properly. We’ll discuss these shortly. 
The most exciting thing about Bootstrap’s modal? You don’t have to write a single line of JavaScript to use it! All the code and styles are predefined by Bootstrap. All that’s required is that you use the proper markup and the attributes to trigger it.
